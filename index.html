              My research interests focus on the use of spectroscopy to investigate
              the relationship between a galaxy's ISM and energetic phenomena such as young
              stellar populations and AGN. I use rest-frame UV and optical spectroscopy from
              JWST, HST, the SDSS, and other facilities to study line-emitting nebular gas in
              galaxies. Much of my analysis incorporates nebular diagnostics,
              photoionization models, and stellar population synthesis to infer fundamental
              properties of the ISM, stars, ionizing radiation, and ionized gas kinematics in
              other galaxies. I collaborate with astronomers across the world, as a leader of the
              LzLCS team but also through connections made at international conferences and
              (soon) the VANDELS team.<br><br>Below, you can read about some

                  <h4>Lyman Continuum Escape</h4>
                  <p>
                    I am one of the leaders of the
                    <a class="one" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260....1F/abstract">Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey</a>,
                    a large HST/COS program (PI <a class="one" href="https://astronomy.williams.edu/profile/08aej/">Anne Jaskot</a>)
                    aimed at measuring the Lyman continuum (LyC) in the largest sample of z~0.3 galaxies to date.
                    Through my role in the LzLCS, I have fundamentally changed our
                    understanding of Lyman continuum escape by (i) providing a foundational
                    reference sample spanning a very wide parameter space, (ii)
                    <a class="one" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..126F/abstract">testing Lyman
                    continuum diagnostics (like O32 as shown on the left)</a>, and (iii) to investigate the
                    underlying mechanisms of ionizing photon escape. These results are critical to
                    providing empirical constraints on the origins and mechanisms of cosmic Reionization.
                    Direct observations of LyC escape at z>6 are not physically possible; making
                    my results from the LzLCS the primary basis
                    by which we can empirically assess the physical origins of cosmic Reionizaiton.

                <h4>Galaxies and Reionization</h4>
                <p>
                  I am applying low-redshift results from the LzLCS to galaxies at z>2.
                  With <a class="one" href="https://fcullen.github.io/">Fergus Cullen</a>, I am using measurements from VLT/VIMOS+KMOS and
                  Keck/MOSFIRE spectra of a subset of galaxies in <a class="one" href="http://vandels.inaf.it/">VANDELS</a>
                  (PIs McLure and Pentericci) to infer statistically robust estimates of LyC escape fractions. Using
                  calibrations of the results from z = 0.3 and z=2.5-5, I am assessing the new JWST samples of galaxies
                  at z>6 to determine their roles in Cosmic Reionization and whether they imply rapid or prolonged
                  Reionization histories. Preliminary results
                  <a class="one" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231106209C/abstract">from UV slope analysis</a>
                  suggest that all galaxies across the UV luminosity function are involved and that Reionization occurs gradually.

                  <h4>AGN and Star Formation in Low-mass Galaxies</h4>
                  <p>
                    I use IFU, SDSS, and long-slit spectroscopy to investigate the relationships between AGN,
                    star formation, and their host galaxies by analyzing the nebular emission line
                    properties, including flux ratio diagnostics like the BPT, nebular diagnostics,
                    and line profile shapes. I use many tools in these analyses, including PyNeb,
                    MAPPINGS, CLOUDY, and a variety of numerical methods. My research is novel in that
                    I have developed new techniques for analyzing (i) ionized outflows traced by emission
                    lines, (ii) "composite" or ambiguous emission line flux ratios, and (iii) very high
                    ionization emission lines like He II 4686 and [Ne V] 3426. Such tools will be key to
                    understanding the effects of AGN and young stellar populations on their host galaxies.
                    My spectroscopic studies of line-emitting galaxies establish the tools and
                    physical insight necessary to understand the effects that AGN and star formation have
                    on one another and, ultimately, the history and future of their host galaxies.

                    For these projects, I collaborate with

                <h4>Activity in Low-Mass Stars</h4>
                <p>
                  Inspired by a graduate course the astrophysics of stellar
                  interiors, I started a research group to investigate and develop novel
                  diagnostics of the dynamos and structure of low mass (< 1 Msun) stars using
                  Gaia, 2MASS, Kepler, and TESS photometry. I work with two other PhD candidates,
                  <a class="one" href="https://www.umass.edu/astronomy/people/graduate-student/sandra-bustamante">Sandra Bustamante</a> (UMass)
                  and <a class="one" href="https://physics.dartmouth.edu/people/aylin-garcia-soto">Aylin Garcia Soto</a> (Dartmouth), as well as
                  rising graduate student <a class="one" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-alvarado-anderson-7792491a7/">Chase Alvarado-Anderson</a> (Stanford).
                  With this team, I use time series and multivariate statistical analysis tools to
                  develop a novel method for gaining insight into the relationships between stellar
                  structure and dynamos, which has strong implications for exoplanet habitability.
                  Specifically, constraining the mass at which stellar activity due to dynamos and
                  interior structure will determine the mass regime in which exoplanets are too
                  irradiated by stellar radiation to support life.
                  Here, I show a variety of stellar activity indicators as a
                  function of the Rossby number Ro = rotation period / convective cycle time
                  to illustrate the empirical relationship between stellar structure, dynamos, and activity.
                  Also depicted is a demonstration of various time series analysis tools used to
                  measure stellar rotation, a key indicator of magnetic activity.

                <h4>AGN Chemical Abundances</h4>
                <p>
                  I study the relationships between nebular emission lines,
                  chemical abundances, and physical properties like temperature
                  and density in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Currently, I collaborate with
                  <a class="one" href="https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/32467/oli-luiz-dors-junior">Oli Dors</a>
                  and others on the abundance patterns in nearby Seyfert galaxies,
                  including the temperature structure of the AGN narrow-line region
                  and possible effects of shocks. Better understanding of the chemical abundances
                  of the ISM in AGN will provide new and crucial evidence regarding the metal enrichment
                  and baryonic in/outflow history in galaxies, including demonstrating whether AGN
                  are in some way influencing or influenced by their host galaxies.
                  <br>To the right, I illustrate a method for interpreting
                  nebular emission line spectra by predicting BPT-VO flux ratios using chemical abundances
                  and ion fractions for both AGN and star-forming galaxies (no photoionization models involved).
