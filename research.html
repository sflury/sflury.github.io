Research

My research interests focus primarily on the use of spectroscopy to investigate
the relationship between a galaxy's ISM and energetic phenomena such as young
stellar populations and AGN. I use rest-frame UV and optical spectroscopy from
JWST, HST, the SDSS, and other facilities to study line-emitting gas in local
(z<0.5) galaxies. Much of my analysis incorporates nebular diagnostics,
photoionization models, and stellar population synthesis to infer fundamental
properties of the ISM, stars, ionizing radiation, and ionized gas kinematics in
other galaxies. Currently, I work on a variety of projects led by faculty at
multiple institutions, which has given me the opportunity for extensive
collaboration with astronomers across the world.

With <a href="https://astronomy.williams.edu/profile/08aej/">Anne Jaskot</a>
(Williams College), I am using a combination of
UV spectroscopy with HST/COS
(the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260....1F/abstract">LzLCS</a>,
<a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=15626">GO 15626</a>) and optical spectroscopy with
SDSS to investigate the production and escape of ionizing photons in z~0.3
low-mass star-forming galaxies. The LzLCS has fundamentally changed our
understanding of the origins of cosmic reionization by providing a foundational
reference sample spanning a very wide parameter space. With the LzLCS, I have
found substantial scatter in nearly all proposed tracers of Lyman continuum
escape and established that ionizing feedback, rather than supernovae, is the
key mechanism for facilitating LyC escape.

With <a href="https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/32467/oli-luiz-dors-junior">Oli Dors, Jr</a>, (UNIVAP), I am using optical spectroscopy to investigate the
temperature structure and chemical composition of ionized gas in AGN. We use a
combination of CLOUDY (see Oli's extensive AGN series) and MAPPINGS to assess
effects of nebular properties and physics on the apparent temperature structure
to obtain insight from our empirical constraints using nebular auroral lines.

With <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/academics/faculty/emoran/profile.html">Ed Moran</a> (Wesleyan University), I am using IFU,
SDSS, and long-slit spectroscopy to investigate the relationships between AGN,
star formation, and their host galaxies by analyzing the nebular emission line
properties, including flux ratio diagnostics like the BPT, nebular diagnostics,
and line profile shapes. With Ed, I have mentored several Master's students and
directly assisted with their final thesis projects.

In a different vein, inspired by a graduate course the astrophysics of stellar
interiors, I started a research group to investigate and develop novel
diagnostics of the dynamos and structure of low mass (< 1 Msun) stars using
Gaia, 2MASS, Kepler, and TESS photometry. I work with two other PhD candidates,
<a href="https://www.umass.edu/astronomy/people/graduate-student/sandra-bustamante">Sandra Bustamante</a> (UMass)
and <a href="https://physics.dartmouth.edu/people/aylin-garcia-soto">Aylin Garcia Soto</a> (Darmouth), as well as
rising graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-alvarado-anderson-7792491a7/">Chase Alvarado-Anderson</a> (Stanford).
