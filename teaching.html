<p> Teaching </p>

<p>I have experience with a variety of introductory astronomy classes both for
majors and for non-majors. My most extensive TA work involved developing and
teaching observational astronomy labs involving the use of python and
numerical methods. These labs focused on developing specific technical skills
in python for solving problems in data analysis and modeling, particularly in
the use of linear algebra, convergence tests, boundary and initial value
problems, modular design, array management, and image processing.</p>

<p>To illustrate the exercises I developed for my students, here is a zoom-in on the
fractal produced from the Mandelbrot set. I had students write functions to test
the Mandelbrot set for divergence over a grid of input values and map the test
results into an image like the one shown here. The skills they developed here
were then directly applied to manual data reduction of raw images they recorded
on a CCD mounted on a 17 inch reflector.</p>
