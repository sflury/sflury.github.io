            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span
              >
              <p>Welcome! My name is Sophia. I started my astronomy career as a physics major in
              college. I loved quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and statistics in part because
              of their probabilistic approach to understanding systems, ensembles, and particles.
              When I first
              got to see a rest-frame optical AGN emission spectrum as an undergrad, I asked
              question after question about emission mechanisms, line profiles, and nebular
              astrophysics. I enjoy the intersection of so many branches of physics in a context
              where a holistic understanding is necessary to interpret what we observe in nebulae
              and in other galaxies. </p>

              <p>Getting from there to here was not easy. I tried three separate
              times to get into an astronomy
              PhD program before I was waitlisted at UMass. I did a Master's program, worked
              in planetary science, and wrote my first publication in my efforts to progress
              to the next level. I discovered many barriers to entry for people like me --
              transgender, struggling with mental health, socioeconomically disadvantaged.
              As a result, I have developed a deep
              empathy for others and an active dedication to representation (diversity), to
              meeting others where they are (equity), and
              to ensuring everyone feels that they belong in our community (inclusion).</p>

              <p>My PhD experience was heavily impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. Courses and
              research were fully remote, which forced me to develop my independence as a
              worker, thinker, researcher, and scientist far earlier than otherwise might have
              been expected. But my work with mentors and collaborators has opened up the wider
              astronomical community to me. Through these international connections, I have
              learned the power of cooperation over competition and the importance of
              forging long-term relationships with collaborators. While I am passionate about
              investigating the nature of line-emitting galaxies, I have come to love
              astronomy as a community of delightfully human scientists.</p>

                <h4>Reading</h4>
                <p>
                  I read. Voraciously. Recent compelling books include
                    "East of Eden" by Steinbeck,
                    "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien,
                    "The Book of Strange New Things" by Michael Faber, and
                    "The Priory of the Orange Tree" by Samantha Shannon.

                <h4>Bread</h4>
                <p>
                  I bake bread. I enjoy the feeling of kneading dough, of seeing various pre-ferments and
                  combinations of yeast, flour, salt, and water produce such wonderfully different
                  flavors and textures. Favorites to bake include focaccia, challah, and pain de compagne.

                <h4>Board Games</h4>
                <p>
                  I enjoy the combined problem solving and social elements of tabletop board games.
                  Current games I avidly play with friends and fmaily include
                  "Settlers of Catan", "Terraforming Mars", and "Wingspan".

                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>
                  I play classical piano. Currently I am working on solo versions of
                  "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" by Rachmaninoff,
                  "Nocturne in C# Minor" by Chopin,
                  "1st Arabesque" by Debussy, and
                  "1st Gymnopedie" by Satie; and ensemble arrangements of
                  "Greensleeves" and various pieces from Studio Ghibli.
