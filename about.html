<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Sophia. I started my astronomy career as a physics major in
college. I loved quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and statistics. When I first
got to see a rest-frame optical AGN emission spectrum as an undergrad, I asked
question after question about emission mechanisms, line profiles, and nebular
astrophysics. My curiosity was, and still is, insatiable. I had to learn more.</p>

<p>The Journey was not easy. I tried three separate times to get into an astronomy
PhD program before I was waitlisted at UMass. I did a Master's program, worked
in planetary science, and wrote my first publication in my efforts to progress
to the next level. I discovered many barriers to entry for people like me --
transgender, mental health, socioeconomic. As a result, I have developed a deep
empathy for others and an active dedication to diversity, equity, and belonging.</p>

<p>My PhD experience was heavily impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. Courses and
research were fully remote, which forced me to develop my independence as a
worker, thinker, researcher, and scientist far earlier than otherwise might have
been expected. But my work with the LzLCS has opened up a wider, international
astronomical community to me. I have grown not just in my technical prowess but
also in my appreciation for the bigger picture, the global scale of our small
but rigorous field.</p>

<h3> Non-Astronomy Interests </h3>

<p> I read. Voraciously. Recent compelling books include
  "East of Eden" by Steinbeck,
  "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien, and
  "The Book of Strange New Things" by Michael Faber.
</p>

<p> I bake bread. This was not part of the pandemic bread-baking craze. I simply
love the feeling of kneading dough, of seeing various pre-ferments and
combinations of yeast, flour, salt, and water produce such wonderfully different
flavors and textures. Favorites to bake include focaccia and pain de compagne.
</p>

<p> I have three cats. They are doofuses. I love them. </p>

<p> I am part of a diverse community of local fiber artists (knitting, tatting,
crotchet, quilting, spinning, etc). I do the fiber art of embroidery. It is
tedious but soothing.</p>

<p> I play classical piano. Pieces I am learning/finessing include
"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" - Rachmaninoff,
"Nocturne in C# Minor" - Chopin,
"1st Arabesque" - Debussy,
"1st Gymnopedie" - Satie.
</p>

<p> My best friend got me into board games when we were kids. It's a great way
to problem solve, cooperatively or competitively, learn new ways to think about
systems with different rules, develop teamwork skills, learn to embrace setbakcs
and losses, and to build social connections and community. Current games I am
into include "Settlers of Catan", "Terraforming Mars", "Wingspan", and
"Race for the Galaxy".</p>
